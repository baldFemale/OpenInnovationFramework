In this version, the G representation goes back to [A, B] system
The outcome variables are limited within Average and Maximum fitness
The IVs are limited within Composition, Openness, and Quality
The Direction dimension is moved into the mechanism check experiments. And we only consider three extreme case: GG, SS, GS, SG
To enable the mechanism of surface reinforcement, we add more surface-related variables, including the surface divergence, surface quality, surface utilization

The simulation configuration is adjusted into more Landscape iteration and less agent number.
