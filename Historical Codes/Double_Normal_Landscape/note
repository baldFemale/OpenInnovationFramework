This version is implemented after AOM acceptance but before the AOM presentation

This model adopt a double sampling from uniform distribution to construct a 4-state landscape

--First, generate the binary landscape as usual
--Second, based on the Fitness Contribution Matrix (BinFC), generate 2^(K+1) points from every position in BinFC
Then we can get a new 4^(K+1) Fitness Contribution Matrix (QuartFC)
--Third, generalists search on binary landscape and get performance (and feedback) from it
Specialists search on quarterly landscape and get performance (and feedback) from it
--The problem arises from this separate landscape; we cannot distinguish what is the source of performance gap;
Actually, G and S will perform the same. The performance gap arises from the hyper-parameter "alpha"
-> the alpha further complex the landscape by adding one more complexity within the domain yet across granularity.
(see the results at E:\data\gst-0730-23\Alpha)

Therefore, I want to roll back to a previous version that G and S will search on the same landscape but perceive it from different cognitive landscape

Therefore, we may attribute the performance difference to the perception about problem space that guides the search dynamics.
